The objective of this project is to develop a tool that detects data quality (DQ) incidents within financial portfolios. By analyzing data from various sources, including MyMetrics, the tool identifies potential issues that might affect the accuracy of Profit & Loss (PnL) and other risk metrics. This approach is designed to flag suspect portfolios or groups of portfolios for further review, helping analysts prioritize and optimize their daily workload.
