Warning: Handling Booking Incidents from SGWorkflow

Please be aware that booking incidents retrieved from SGWorkflow have an asof date that is delayed by one day (i.e., the data reflects the state as of J+1). This is a known issue that should be addressed in a future update.

In the meantime, exercise caution when retrieving new data from this source, as this date misalignment may impact time-sensitive analyses or reporting
