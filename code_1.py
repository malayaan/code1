## Next Steps: Continuous Data and Time Series Modeling

The next steps will involve leveraging **continuous data** from IA3, potentially through **time series modeling**, for both deal-level and portfolio-level analysis. This approach will allow:

- **Expert Models by Product Type**: Develop expert models tailored for each product type, both at the deal and portfolio level.
- **Time Series for Adjustments**: Use continuous data to better capture trends and anomalies over time, improving model accuracy.

### Key Actions:
1. **Explore Time Series Models**: Apply time series analysis to capture evolving trends in data quality issues.
2. **Expert-Based Segmentation**: Build expert models for different filters like product type to handle specific data behaviors.
3. **Refine Anomaly Detection**: Utilize continuous data for more precise detection of anomalies and apply adjustments where necessary.

This will enable a more nuanced detection approach, leveraging detailed, product-specific insights over time, at both the deal and portfolio levels.
