### Slide 2: Introduction
**Objective:**  
To classify deals to identify whether they present a Data Quality (DQ) incident or not.

**Context:**  
We have limited our data environment to a specific trading desk to develop an effective classifier.

---

### Slide 3: Why Focus on a Specific Trading Desk?
**Unique Characteristics:**  
- Each trading desk operates differently with unique methods and evaluation criteria.
- Focusing on one desk allows for creating a model tailored to its specific reasoning.

**Data Management:**  
- Limiting data scope helps in better managing and tuning the dataset.
- Our systems cannot handle very large datasets, making this approach practical.

---

### Slide 4: Importance of Data Quality
**Garbage In, Garbage Out:**  
- High-quality input data is crucial for a successful model.
- If the model does not have all the relevant information used by analysts, it cannot replicate their decision-making process effectively.

**Feature Engineering:**  
- More time can be spent on developing and understanding the features that influence the analysis.

---

### Slide 5: What is a Classifier?
**Definition:**  
A classifier is an AI tool that learns from existing data to predict categories or labels for new data.

**Example in Our Context:**  
- Our classifier will learn from labeled deals to predict if new deals have DQ incidents.

---

### Slide 6: Need for Labeled Data
**Labeled Data:**  
- The classifier needs labeled data to learn the patterns distinguishing problematic deals from non-problematic ones.

**Training Process:**  
- The model analyzes these patterns and applies what it has learned to new, unlabeled data to make predictions.

---

### Slide 7: How the Classifier Works
**Learning Patterns:**  
- Analyzes labeled data to identify distinguishing characteristics.

**Making Predictions:**  
- Applies learned patterns to new data to predict if a deal has a DQ incident.

**Outcome:**  
- An effective classifier that mimics the reasoning of human analysts in a specific trading desk.

---

### Slide 8: Benefits of This Approach
**Precision:**  
- Tailored model specific to the trading desk ensures high accuracy.

**Efficiency:**  
- Efficient data handling and feature engineering.

**Scalability:**  
- The approach can be adapted and scaled to other trading desks with specific customizations.

---

### Slide 9: Conclusion
**Summary:**  
- Restricting data to a specific trading desk enhances model effectiveness.
- The classifier relies on high-quality, labeled data to learn and make accurate predictions.
- This method ensures that the classifier can replicate the specific reasoning of analysts within that desk.

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue refining the model with new data.
- Expand the approach to other trading desks with necessary customizations.
