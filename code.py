In analyzing referential incidents, a notable observation is the significant presence of NaN values, primarily due to the total absence of data for certain scopes. When data is present, errors most commonly occur at the portfolio level, rarely at the GOP level, and never above. This issue is particularly pronounced in a small group of portfolios that disproportionately contribute to the overall number of incidents, suggesting specific areas for focused improvement and investigation.
