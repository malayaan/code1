In the upcoming phase of my internship, I will conduct a detailed statistical analysis focused on the distribution of incidents across applications, specifically targeting "SG|Workflow" for incidents categorized under "Referential & Booking" and "Unity" for IT-related incidents. This investigation aims to dissect the distribution patterns of incidents across various devices, such as trading desk portfolios, and over different time periods, alongside assessing various risk metrics. The primary objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of what characterizes a data quality incident. By meticulously analyzing these aspects, I intend to identify underlying trends and factors that could inform and guide the subsequent stages of my internship work. This comprehensive study will encompass both scopes, ensuring a holistic understanding of the incident landscape within our operations.
