### Conclusion

Our statistical analysis has pinpointed key opportunities for enhancing Société Générale's incident reporting process to reduce duplicates and improve efficiency. 

First, implementing a feature that allows analysts to update existing reports, including attachments, analyses, or estimated impacts, could significantly decrease the need for duplicate submissions. This update functionality would preserve the continuity of incident tracking and maintain data integrity.

Second, the pre-filled justification columns in the reporting templates need redesigning. These columns currently lack the detail necessary for clear statistical analysis. Enhancing these fields to capture more specific and granular information would improve data accuracy and utility.

Lastly, a new pop-up feature would alert analysts when they select a template ID that matches one used for another incident on the same day and scope. This prompt would encourage them to verify whether they are about to create a duplicate, thereby minimizing redundancy.

These improvements will streamline the incident management process at Société Générale, allowing the bank to focus resources on resolving genuine issues more efficiently.
