### Data Description

The data used in this analysis are sourced from three CSV files hosted in the 'DataFrame' directory of our Git repository. These files, named `Booking.csv`, `Referential.csv`, and `IT.csv`, encompass various incident reports relevant to their respective domains within Société Générale's operations. Each file was specifically designated to track and analyze the different aspects of data quality incidents—ranging from IT-related issues to booking and referential integrity problems.

The data were collected by Benjamin Pocart and Caroline Kao, who are responsible for the initial accumulation of incident reports. Subsequent preprocessing was conducted by Paul Decoux, detailed in the `DataCleaning` section of the Git repository. This preprocessing step was crucial for ensuring the data's usability for further analysis, particularly in preparing it for the duplicate detection process.

These files contain extensive columns that record critical incident details such as dates, perimeters, root causes, templates used, and the analysts' explanations, along with the responses to these incidents. Such comprehensive data fields are instrumental in tracing and categorizing incidents, including the differentiation between potential true and faux duplicates. This categorization is key to our statistical analysis, aiming to enhance the overall efficiency of incident management by reducing redundancies and improving response time to genuine issues.
